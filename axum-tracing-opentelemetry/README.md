Middlewares and tools to integrate axum + tracing + opentelemetry.

- Read OpenTelemetry header from incoming request
- Start a new trace if no trace found in the incoming request
- Trace is attached into tracing'span

For examples, you can look at:

- the [examples](https://github.com/davidB/toolkit-tracing-opentelemetry/examples/) folder
- [davidB/sandbox_axum_observability: Sandbox to experiment axum and observability](https://github.com/davidB/sandbox_axum_observability). This example shows also propagation of the trace between tracing span and service (via reqwest).

```rust
//...
use axum_tracing_opentelemetry::opentelemetry_tracing_layer;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), axum::BoxError> {
    // very opinionated init of tracing, look as is source to make your own
    init_tracing_opentelemetry::tracing_subscriber_ext::init_subscribers()?;

    let app = app();
    // run it
    let addr = &"0.0.0.0:3000".parse::<SocketAddr>()?;
    tracing::warn!("listening on {}", addr);
    axum::Server::bind(&addr)
        .serve(app.into_make_service())
        .with_graceful_shutdown(shutdown_signal())
        .await?;
    Ok(())
}

fn app() -> Router {
    // build our application with a route
    Router::new()
        .route("/", get(health)) // request processed inside span
        // opentelemetry_tracing_layer setup `TraceLayer`, that is provided by tower-http so you have to add that as a dependency.
        .layer(opentelemetry_tracing_layer())
        .route("/health", get(health)) // request processed without span / trace
}

async fn shutdown_signal() {
    //...
    opentelemetry::global::shutdown_tracer_provider();
}
```

To also inject the trace id into the response (could be useful for debugging) uses the layer `response_with_trace_layer`

```rust
    // build our application with a route
    Router::new()
        ...
        // include trace context as header into the response
        .layer(response_with_trace_layer())
```

For more info about how to setup, you can look at crate `init-tracing-opentelemetry` or `tracing-opentelemetry`.

## Changelog - History

### 0.12

- ðŸ’¥ extract tools, tonic,... into separated crates

### 0.11

- upgrade to opentelemetry 0.19

### 0.10

- ðŸ’¥ default configuration for otlp Sampler is no longer hardcoded to `always_on`, but read environment variables `OTEL_TRACES_SAMPLER`, `OTEL_TRACES_SAMPLER_ARG`
- âœ¨ provide opinionated `tracing_subscriber_ext`
- âœ¨ log under target `otel::setup` detected configuration by otel setup tools
- âœ¨ add a axum layer for gRPC (#36) (wip)

### 0.9

- add `DetectResource` builder to help detection for [Resource Semantic Conventions | OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/reference/specification/resource/semantic_conventions/#semantic-attributes-with-sdk-provided-default-value)

### 0.8

- add `init_propagator` to configure the global propagator based on content of the env variable [OTEL_PROPAGATORS](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/concepts/sdk-configuration/general-sdk-configuration/#otel_propagators)

### 0.7

- add a layer`response_with_trace_layer` to have `traceparent` injected into response
- improve discovery of otlp configuration based on `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_TRACES_ENDPOINT`, `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT`, `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_TRACES_PROTOCOL`, `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL`

### 0.6

- upgrade to axum 0.6
